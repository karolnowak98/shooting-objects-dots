Description of the game: It's the game from my other repos, but created using Unity DOTS. When the game starts, the player can choose how many objects does he want to spawn. After selecting an option, turret-like cubes spawn in random places on the map, each turret rotates and fires. The game ends when the last cube remains and the game can be reloaded with the replay button.
